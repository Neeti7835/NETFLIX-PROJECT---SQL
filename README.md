# NETFLIX-PROJECT---SQL
In this project, we analyzed a dataset consisting of movies and TV shows available on Netflix as of mid-2021. Netflix, a leading media and video streaming platform with over 200 million subscribers globally, offers a diverse library of over 8000 titles. The dataset contains key attributes such as title, cast, directors, ratings, release year, genres, duration, and more.

The goal of this project was to leverage SQL to explore and analyze various aspects of Netflix's content library and provide insights into trends, preferences, and the composition of its catalog.

Key Objectives: Content Breakdown:

Determine the distribution of content types (Movies vs. TV Shows). Analyze the number of titles released each year to identify trends in content production. Genre Popularity:

Identify the most frequent genres on Netflix. Find patterns in popular genres for movies vs. TV shows. Top Directors and Cast Members:

Use SQL queries to find the most featured directors and actors across Netflix's titles. Analyze the contribution of leading actors and directors to the content catalog. Content Rating Analysis:

Group titles by their ratings (e.g., PG, R, TV-MA) to understand the type of content most prevalent on the platform. Identify trends based on audience targeting (kids, general, mature content). Duration of Content:

For movies, calculate the average duration and identify the longest and shortest films. For TV shows, analyze the average number of seasons and episode counts. Country-based Content:

Analyze content availability based on the country of origin. Identify countries producing the most content for Netflix.

Insights Derived:

The content library is more inclined towards movies, with a large percentage of titles being feature films compared to TV shows.

The most common genres are “Dramas,” “Comedies,” and “Documentaries,” with a growing trend in international content, especially from countries like India, South Korea, and Japan.

Popular actors and directors have multiple collaborations with Netflix, adding to the platform’s star power.

TV shows tend to be slightly longer in terms of the number of episodes per season, especially in genres like drama and reality TV.

Netflix’s content caters to a wide range of audiences, with a balanced mix of general audience ratings and mature content (TV-MA).

Tools and Skills:

SQL: Used for querying and analyzing the dataset, joining tables, grouping data, and performing aggregations.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing data and inconsistencies within the dataset, such as null values in director or cast columns.

Conclusion:

This SQL-based Netflix data analysis provided valuable insights into the platform’s content catalog and subscriber preferences. The analysis can guide business decisions in content acquisition, production, and personalization strategies to enhance user experience.
